# Mask-Detection-using-CNN
This project is centered around COVID-19,  the major health concern the world is facing currently. The  focus of reducing the spread of the virus is around face  masks, and the laws that many world institutions are  putting in place mandating their wear in public places. This  project proposes a method of image analysis that uses  Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) to classify images into  three separate categories: face masks, no face mask, or  incorrectly worn face mask. In this project, a tool is created  that anyone can use to gather information if the individuals  are wearing face masks, not wearing a face mask, or  wearing their face mask incorrectly quickly and easily.
